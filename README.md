This website is and aid for both practitioners and patients to visualise all medical data. Patient-side allow each patient to acces their personal data, a history of their previous consultations, the foresight of the upcoming consultation, the ability to modify them and, of course, the ability to make an appointment. Practitioner-side allow each doctor to access to all patients registered into the database of the facility. Thus, they can add, modify and suppress a patient and their personnal informations. They are also able to see the patient file composed of all his previous consultation and the up-to-come. If the doctor the one weloming the patient, it can modifiy the comment of the consultation until the consultation is over. Admin-side allow an administrator to add, modify and suppress a practitioner. We imagine that the admin is an IT manager inside the facility and that the practitioners have a local e-mail adress and may ask the IT manager to make changes on their practitioner profile.
